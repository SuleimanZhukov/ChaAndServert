# Chat and Server
Server that you run, then you run chat (you can run it several times to have multiple users) and you enjoy chatting.

# What I Learned
I learned how to create GUI in Java.
I learned CSS.
I learned SQLite and basic commands (CRUD), and how to connect to data base with JDBC in Java, 
in this program you can register, you can login, and it saves all the data in the data base.
I also learned how to transfer data between server and the client.
